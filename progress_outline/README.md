# Requirements of Outline

No strict structure is required, but you are expected to describe the problem, discuss aspects of your initial literature review and outline your plans for the next steps. Depending on the project, these can e.g. involve data preparation that is expected to be undertaken, programming work that needs to be carried out, methods you plan to explore, experiments that will be performed, possible extensions to the project etc
